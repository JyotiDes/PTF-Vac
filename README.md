# PTF-Vāc
PTF-Vāc is an advanced deep learning-based system designed for ab-initio discovery of plant transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) without relying on predefined motifs or species-specific models. It employs a generative deep co-learning encoder-decoder architecture that learns universal patterns of TF-DNA interactions by jointly modeling variations in both transcription factor structures and their binding sequences. Unlike traditional motif-based approaches, PTF-Vāc can accurately identify binding sites even for previously uncharacterized TF families or novel plant species. This method decouples binding site prediction from the prior need for motif discovery, enabling reliable genome annotation across diverse plants by capturing species- and TF-independent binding features.
